        implementers understand the context of the standard. They are also
        sometimes specified to assist implementers in establishing working
        HL7-based systems. </p>

        messages among information systems that implement healthcare
        applications. However, V3 strives to improve the V2 process and its
        outcomes. The original process for defining HL7 messages was
        established in 1987. It has served well since. However, as HL7
        membership grew and its standards became more widely used, HL7 has
        become aware of opportunities to revolutionize healthcare interface
        computing. HL7 interfaces substantially reduce costs and implementation
        times when compared to the industry's experience with proprietary
        interfaces. However, these costs and times vary considerably by vendor,
        and the industry sees a need for improvement. Substantial optionality
        in HL7 makes it difficult to specify precise contract terms for HL7
        interfaces. This can lead to unrealistic expectations that hurt vendors
        and buyers equally. The development principles behind HL7 V3 lead to a
        more robust, fully specified standard. </p>

          <li><strong>Internationalization</strong>: V3 shall include
            mechanisms that support the need for local variants of HL7 messages
            to be used by HL7 Affiliates. It shall be possible for affiliates
            to use the messages created by the worldwide HL7 organization. It
            shall also be possible for affiliates to develop and use localized
            variants. </li>
          <li><strong>Legacy Systems Support</strong>: As with prior versions,
            V3 shall be designed using a technological approach that permits
            implementation in "legacy systems." These are systems that have
            been implemented in technical environments that do not necessarily
            conform to or provide support for recent or pending "open systems"
            standards, such as those published by ISO, Open Systems Foundation,
            Object Management Group, etc. Similarly, HL7 will not require
            proprietary features of any operating system or software vendor. In
            practical terms, this means that V3 shall be able to exchange
            messages formatted in strings of printable characters, as is the
            case for all previous versions. This does not preclude HL7 from
            deciding to develop variants of its specification that make use of
            the modern technologies provided that 1) System builders will not
            be required to buy software from a sole source in order to
            implement V3, and 2) Messages generated in these formats have the
            same data content so that translation between the printable
            character format and other formats is easy. </li>
          <li><p><strong>Loosely Coupled Systems</strong>: As with HL7 V2.x, V3
            shall not be a standard for the functionality of the systems that
            exchange HL7 messages. However, where V3 includes a requirement to
            accept or send certain data or to send specific messages in
            response to trigger events or other messages, the application
            system may have to develop functionality to support those
            requirements. </p>
            <p>V3 messages may be sent using many modes and topologies.
            Messages may be sent in a manner that requires an immediate
            response, as unsolicited updates through a store and forward
            network, or in batches where the manner and timing of message
            transfer is not specified. V3 includes support for "one-to-many,"
            store-and-forward distribution of messages by an external software
            agent. </p>
          </li>
          <li><p><strong>V2.x Functional Compatibility</strong>: HL7 V3 goals
            cannot be achieved while maintaining full compatibility with
            previous versions. However, upon completion, V3 shall cover the
            information content of the last version in the V2.x series
            including attributes and trigger events. This should not be
            construed to mean that all attributes and trigger events will be
            included in V3 in exactly the same form as within the V2.x series.
            </p>
            <p>A network that includes a mixture of systems that implement V2
            and V3 will require message translation. Because the V2 standards
            have substantial optionality, the translations will use rules
            specific to the systems on that network. It is expected that
            interface engines and other translation software will be able to
            provide the translations between site-specific interpretations of
            V2.x and any implementation of V3. </p>
          </li>
          <li><p><strong>Upward Compatibility Among V3.x</strong>: HL7 will
            provide the maximum degree possible of interoperability among
            systems operating on older and newer versions of HL7 protocols in
            the V3 family through compatible enhancement. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A message structure that is modified in a newer version of
                the protocol must be acceptable to a system designed for the
                prior V3 release. However, a system built for the prior release
                will only extract the information that was defined for that
                prior release. </li>
              <li>A message structure created in accordance with an older
                version of the V3 protocol must be acceptable to a system
                designed for a later V3 release. In some cases, this will mean
                that the system built for the newer release will not receive
                certain information fields because they were not a part of the
                older version of the message structure in use by a specific
                sender. </li>
              <li>Where compatible enhancement is not possible, HL7 will
                require evolution in the protocol to happen gradually, so that
                users can introduce the change into their networks gradually.
              </li>
              <li>The messages associated with all interactions that are newly
                defined in a version of HL7 must not be sent to a receiver that
                conforms to the older version. </li>
              <li>A message structure may be declared obsolescent in one
                release, with a stated alternative message structure. Both the
                obsolescent message structure and its alternative can be used
                by all systems supporting that release. </li>
              <li>The obsolescent message structure may be declared obsolete
                and dropped when still another HL7 version is issued. </li>
              <li>An obsolescent message structure may not be declared obsolete
                for at least two years from the date of the version that first
                declared it obsolescent. </li>
              <li>The above notwithstanding, if a new Implementation Technology
                Specification (ITS) is introduced, HL7 may specify that
                conformance to the ITS does not require dealing with message
                structures that are obsolescent when the new ITS is introduced.
                To the maximum degree possible, these restrictions should not
                impose limitations on the evolution of the overall reference
                model. There are no restrictions on making changes to the
                information model if those changes do not impact the message
                structures that were described in a prior version of the
                Standard. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><p><strong>Determining Conformance</strong>: Application roles
            are the basis for conformance claims. An application role is an
            abstraction that expresses a portion of the messaging behavior of
            an information system. Application role names are different than
            the names generally used to describe healthcare information system
            products, since they describe messaging interfaces as opposed to
            application behavior. A typical healthcare information system will
            probably fill several or many application roles. </p>
            <p>In making a conformance claim, a system developer identifies the
            application roles to which it wishes to claim conformance. For
            these application roles, the V3 specification will state directly
            the trigger events the system shall recognize, messages that the
            system shall send in response to trigger events or other messages,
            and the data content of these messages. The specification also
            states the messages that a system conforming to the application
            role shall receive and process. </p>
            <p>All conformance claims shall be sufficiently specific to be used
            as contractual terms in system acquisitions and to be the basis for
            testing by an independent testing organization. </p>
            <p>User sites may contract with vendors to implement deviations
            from the HL7 conformance claims. Such arrangements are outside the
            scope of HL7. Such an arrangement will not be considered a failure
            of the application to conform to HL7. </p>
            <p>All sequences of messages in V3 shall be related to a trigger
            event. The trigger event shall be clearly identified in a common
            field in all messages. </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Confidentiality of Patient Information</strong>: It is
            expected that healthcare application systems that implement V3 will
            be required to have significantly more functionality to protect the
            confidentiality of patient information than has been common in the
            past. The new functions may include, but are not limited to,
            limiting the right to view or transfer selected data to users with
            specific kinds of authorization and auditing access to patient
            data. V3 will seek out and adopt industry security standards that
            support conveying the necessary information from one healthcare
            application system to another, so that these systems may perform
            the confidentiality functions. The Functional Committees, the
            Control Group, and the Modeling and Methodology Committee shall
            consult with the Security &amp; Accountability SIG while developing
            the HL7 Data Model and V3 messages. </li>
          <li><strong>Authenticated Authorization for Services</strong>: It is
            expected that the healthcare application systems that implement V3
            will be required to have significantly more functionality to
            authenticate requests for services and reports of data than has
            been common in the past. The new functions may include, but are not
            limited to, electronic signature and authentication of users based
            on technologies more advanced than passwords. V3 will seek out and
            reference standards such as X.500 and RFC 1510 to support conveying
            the necessary information from one healthcare application system to
            another, so that these systems may perform the authorization and
            authentication functions. The functional Technical Committees, the
            Control Group, and the Modeling and Methodology Committee shall
            consult with the Security &amp; Accountability SIG while developing
            the HL7 Data Model and V3 transactions. </li>
          <li><strong>Security, Privacy, Non-Repudiation and
            Integrity</strong>: It is expected that the technological platforms
            upon which V3 information systems developers implement applications
            that use HL7 will be required to have significantly more capability
            to protect the confidentiality and integrity of patient information
            than has been common in the past. The new functions may include,
            but are not limited to, public- and private-key encryption, and
            correspondent system authentication and non-repudiation. The
            Control Group is monitoring these developments to ensure that V3
            can be implemented on technological platforms that support these
            new functions. </li>

          <li><strong>HL7 V3 adopts an Object Oriented (OO) approach using
            Unified Modeling Language (UML) principles.</strong> HL7 employs a
            completely new development approach with V3. HL7 V3 uses an OO
            approach that is model and repository-based. This OO approach is
            supported with trained facilitators, formal education classes, and
            computerized tools. This approach leads to increased detail,
            clarity and precision of the specification and finer granularity in
            the ultimate message. This helps functional committees meet the
            challenges of de novo interface design, and increases functional
            breadth and evolution of assumptions. It helps new members become
            productive in fewer meetings. This is an enormous aid to providing
            institutional memory and sharing work in progress across committees
            and to the membership at large. </li>
          <li><strong>HL7 isn't just Level 7 any more!</strong> After years of
            implementing HL7 V2.x, HL7 standard developers realized it was
            virtually impossible to develop a comprehensive standard without
            including other levels of the International Organization for
            Standardization (ISO) Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) Model. Today,
            committees exist for XML, Security &amp; Accountability, Modeling
            &amp; Methodology, Arden Syntax, CCOW and Vocabulary. </li>
          <li><strong>Reduced Optionality.</strong> Limiting optionality is a
            primary goal of HL7 V3. Within HL7 V2.x, almost every field is
            optional. This optionality is necessary since optionality is
            defined by segment and segments are reused in multiple messages.
            Declaration of a data field as optional within a segment allows
            that segment to be used in many different messages without any
            further definition. However, the wide use of optionality, while
            helpful in gaining consensus and in writing a somewhat more compact
            specification, imposes significant costs on interface implementers.
            In fact, optionality, as a "feature" of HL7 V 2.x, is associated
            with most of the issues that V3 is trying to solve. Optionality
            makes it harder to precisely define the semantics of a specific
            message and makes it virtually impossible to generate conformance
            claims for messaging. </li>
          <li><strong>Conformance to HL7 V3 will be testable.</strong> It is
            difficult to measure compliance of HL7 V2.x interfaces. Often
            vendors claim compliance to HL7 without providing any supporting
            documentation of how they conform. Terms such as HL7-like or
            HL7-ish are used to describe HL7 interfaces. With HL7 V3,
            conformance is specified in terms of application roles. Application
            roles are abstractions that express a portion of the messaging
            behavior of an information system. A vendor of a healthcare
            application describes its conformance by asserting that it
            completely supports all trigger events, messages and data elements
            associated with one or more application roles. This level of
            specificity allows clearer pre-contractual understanding between
            vendors and buyers and will serve as a basis for conformance
            testing. </li>

            for that field would consist of the allowed values for that field,
            such as, single, married, divorced, and separated. Each coded
