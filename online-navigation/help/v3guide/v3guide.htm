        work-in-progress that will more fully emerge in future versions. Early

        of the Health Level Seven (HL7) Working Group as a companion to the V3
        Standard. An earlier document the Message Development Framework
        contained additional supporting design and architecture material for
        V3. However the MDF has not been maintained in alignment with current
        V3 ballots and is therefore not recommended for use. A new document the
        HDF, HL7 Development Framework will in time provide the replacement for
        the MDF. However it contains changes to the UML notations and approach
        which vary from this Ballot and in any case is still in draft form.

        (ITS), as used within the HL7 Version 3 specifications. The MESSAGING
        COMPONENTS section provides guidance on the artifacts found in the
        Version 3 standard, such as storyboards, trigger events, interactions,
        etc., and is intended to help the reader understand how to read and use
        these artifacts. Readers of the V3 Guide will need a general
        understanding of both the foundation and messaging components to
        understand the V3 Specifications themselves. </p>

          <li><strong>Reference Information Model (RIM)- </strong> The RIM is
            used to express the information content for the collective work of
            the HL7 Working Group. It is the information model that encompasses
            the HL7 domain of interest as a whole. The RIM is a coherent,
            shared information model that is the source for the data content of
            all HL7 messages. As such, it provides consistent data and concept
            reuse across multiple information structures, including messages.
            The RIM is maintained by a collaborative, consensus building
            process involving all Technical Committees and Special Interest
            Groups. This process, known as model harmonization, uses standard
            consensus processes, to review, debate, enhance, and reconcile
            change proposals that have been submitted by Technical Committees.
            The resulting changes are applied to the RIM to produce a new
            version. The RIM is intentionally abstract allowing it to represent
            the richness of the information topics that must be shared
            throughout the health system. The principles underlying this
            abstraction are discussed in detail in the introduction to the RIM.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Domain Message Information Model (D-MIM)- </strong> A
            D-MIM is a refined subset of the RIM that includes a set of class
            clones, attributes and relationships that can be used to create
            messages for a particular domain (a particular area of interest in
            healthcare). The D-MIM is used as a common base upon which all
            R-MIMs within a domain are built. The rules for the refinement
            process by which the D-MIMs and R-MIMs are created are discussed in
            detail in the specification on Refinement and Localization. </li>
          <li><strong>Refined Message Information Model (R-MIM)-</strong> The
            R-MIM is a subset of a D-MIM that is used to express the
            information content for a message or set of messages with
            annotations and refinements that are message specific. The content
            of an R-MIM is drawn from the D-MIM for the specific domain in
            which the R-MIM is used. The R-MIM may include clones of selected
            classes with alias names specific to the perspective of the
            message(s) to be derived. The R-MIM represents the information
            content for one or more abstract message structures, also called
            Hierarchal Message Definitions (HMDs). </li>

        state diagram associated with a class in an information model. State
        diagrams, which show all of the potential states for a class, are
        developed for classes that are the central subject of an interaction.
        These classes are called subject classes. Interactions are sometimes
        motivated by changes in the state of a subject class. For example, Act
        may be identified as a subject class. The vocabulary domain for the
        Act.status_cd declares the defined states for the Act. Those states
        include Active, Suspended, Cancelled, Complete, and Aborted. A state
        diagram depicts the allowable class states with a box labeled with the
        name of the state. Changes in state are called state transitions and
        are depicted in the diagram by a line with a arrowhead showing the
        direction of the transition. An example of a state transition might be
        the change in the state of an Act from Active to Complete. The change
        in state (state transition) is associated with a trigger event that
        causes the transition. The trigger event in this example might be the
        fulfillment of an order. An order is a special type of Act. The
        transition from an Active order to a Completed order is triggered by
        the fulfillment of the Order. The state diagram depicts the states,
        trigger event, and state transitions of interest. </p>

        refinement and are one of the main subjects of the Refinement,
        Constraint and Localization specification. Appearance constraints
        modify the status of a model or message element. Elements (defined as
        optional) may be made mandatory or they may be excluded. Cardinality
        constraints change the minimum or maximum number of times that a class
        attribute or an association may appear. Type constraints are about
        substituting a more restricted data type than the once specified for an
        attribute. Only specific substitutions may be made which are defined in
        the XML ITS, or more generally in the abstract Data Types
        specification. The Visio tools make this easy by showing what
        restrictions can be made for any particular attribute being
        constrained. A set of constraints on a message are called a constraint
        profile. In HL7 V3 constraint profiles must be derived from a balloted
        V3 message specification. Conformance is a process by which information
        system sponsors such as vendors communicate to a User organization how
        their products meet HL7 specifications. For future versions of V3,
        conformance claims will have to relate explicitly to the relevant V3
        application roles for a particular message. This is called functional
        conformance. Additionally technical conformance must be shown in
        relation to defined V3 messages and one or more profiles of that
        message. Localization is a process that combines both constraints and
        extensions to existing V3 artifacts. Many organizations may carry out
        localization, but HL7 has explicitly defined when localizations are
        permitted and under what circumstances. Refer to the Localization part
        of the Refinement, Constraint, and Location Section. </p>

      <td class="body_col"><p>The patient, Eve E. Everywoman, is also
        represented with two levels - the patient and the person. The available
        elements within the patient element are few since this is part of a
        closely-coupled message (e.g. there is no space for an address). On the
        other hand, the id is required with the name, thus providing for at
        least some form of error checking. Again, there are IDs on each level -
        the pre-assigned patient ID is on the patient level, while a
        driver&rsquo;s license number is present on the person level as a
        person ID. </p>

        a diagrammatic representation of only those classes, attributes and
        associations that are required for the messages defined by the domain.
        The D-MIM is a subset of the RIM but uses specific conventions to
        represent artifacts such as CMETs and various types of associations.
        Once the classes, attributes and associations for a particular domain
        have been isolated via the D-MIM, the next logical step is to extract,
        from the D-MIM, the set of classes, attributes and associations
        required for an HMD or set of HMDs that originate from the same root
        class. These extractions are referred to as R-MIMs (Refined Message
        Information Models), which are a subset of and use the same conventions
        as the domain D-MIM. </p>

        Clinical Document Repository or Order Placer. These generic roles are
        known as application roles and are depicted in the diagram as vertical

        Create Patient Billing Account and Delete Patient Billing Account are
        examples of interactions found in the HL7 V3 messaging standard. Once

        extensively used in UML applications, is only currently used in HL7 V3
        for application role stereotypes. The term is generally used to refer
        to a closely related group of items within a particular categorisation.
        In application roles, there are currently six stereotypes defined based
        upon the capability of one application to interact with another. At the
        base level, applications simply send or receive notifications of events
        (Informer and Tracker). At the next level applications expect an action
        and response from the application that receives the notification
        (Placer and Fulfiller). At the final level, applications are capable of
        handling confirmations of requests (Confirmer and Confirmation
        Receiver). Use of these standardised stereotype names is intended to
        assist in the definition and use of application roles generally. The
        stereotypes do not form an exclusive set of names for application
        roles. </p>

        documents, the Domain Message Information Model is a diagram that shows
        the relationships between the classes but it uses diagramming
        conventions and notations that were developed by HL7 to represent the
        specific semantic constructs contained in the critical, "back-bone"
        classes of the RIM. Although D-MIMs and R-MIMs could be represented in
        UML notation, as the RIM is, the HL7 notation provides more details
        about the specific constraints and class clones being represented. The
        HL7 diagramming convention abbreviates some relationship conventions,
        enabling diagrams to be smaller and more concise and to convey more
        information visually. Understanding the diagramming conventions and
        notations is key to understanding how to read a D-MIM. The same
        diagramming conventions used for D-MIMs are also used for R-MIMs and
        CMETs (discussed in separate chapters of this guide). The rest of this
        chapter explains the conventions and notations used in the D-MIM
        diagram. Since a D-MIM is typically larger than a single, printable
        page, the figures in this chapter are sample portions of a D-MIM
        diagram that correspond to the convention being discussed. </p>

        naming the clones and associations that appear in a D-MIM or R-MIM.
        This approach assures that similar concepts will have common or similar
        names wherever they are used in HL7 specifications. Class clone names
        for Entity, Role and Act are based upon the class_cd value for the
        class. Additionally, for Act and Entity, the mood_cd or determiner_cd
        also affect the name. For example, an Act with class_cd of OBS

          <li><p>The information model contains a group of classes that
            frequently are interconnected in more than one way. For example,
            there may be associations that lead from Patient to Person directly
            (this is the person who is the patient) and indirectly (this is the
            person who is the next of kin of the patient, or this is the person
            who is the primary physician of the patient). </p>
            <p><em>The communicating systems must be able to determine which of
            the objects derived from these classes contain the data to be sent.
            Furthermore, they must be able to navigate to the related objects
            through the associations that are defined for the classes.</em></p>
          </li>
          <li><p>The same attributes may not be appropriate for different
            objects. Although both the patient and the physician associated
            with a clinical order are people, it is unlikely that we will send
            the physician's religion, date of birth, or sex each time we
            process an order for the patient. </p>
            <p><em>The communicating systems must be aware which of the objects
            will be sent.</em></p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Finally, to send data over the wire, the computer must
            organize it sequentially. There are many different ways to organize
            the data from a group of objects interconnected by their
            associations. If the sender and the receiver do not agree exactly
            on that order, the communication is frustrated. If the sender
            transmits information about the attending physician before that of
            the primary care physician, and the receiver is expecting the
            opposite order, there will be a problem. </p>

            which information will be sent.</em></p>

        without reference to the implementation technology. The HMD defines a

        message structure is never sent and thus has no corresponding trigger

        and with a defined trigger event. It may carry domain content and
        therefore combine the general functionality of an application
        acknowledgement, with the specific response defined by the domain for
        this Interaction. </p>

        by the Control Act wrapper,which is used when information about the
        interaction which has triggered a message needs to be communicated
        within that message to the receiver. In some cases, these interactions
        will have been fully defined by the interaction model and therefore
        there is no need for such information to be included inthe message. Two
        particular areas of application are query sessions and registry
        interactions (such as Master Person Index). Technical committees will
        individually decide when a Control Act wrapper needs to be specified
        for a particular message. A generic wrapper definition is supplied as
        part of the Infrastructure ballot. Technical Committees may carry out
        refinement on the wrapper to meet their own needs. Future tooling will
        need to be able incorporate domain-specific wrappers when necessary.
        This is outside the capability of the current tooling. These wrappers
        are described in the HL7 ballot in three main groupings, described as
        separate domains:- </p>
