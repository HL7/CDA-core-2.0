## CDA Online Navigation

The CDA R2.0 (last published in 2010) was originally developed as a set of webpages but not placed online at that time. This folder contains a reformatted set of webpages that contains the original standard with no changes to normative content. It does make changes to improve external references to examples, stylesheets and other resources. These updates primarily include:   

- "CDA Schemas" now points to the HL7 Github repository that includes the normative schema as well SDTC extensions
- "CDA Example with Stylesheet" now displays original CDA example hosted with 2023 version of HL7 stylesheet
- "CDA Sample Documents" now points to the HL7 CDA repository
- "CDA Refined Message Information Model (R-MIM)" now links to the image and 2023 version in the online CDA publication

The intent is to ballot and publish these new artefacts as CDA R2.0 in 2024/2025. 

### Where to start?

Open the file ```index.html``` in a browser. For best functionality, host the web pages to allow for an CDA example document (XML with stylesheet) to open. 

### When is this being balloted and by whom?

The current intent is to ballot these set of web pages in May 2024. Contact CDA Management Group with questions.
