This CDA R2 Normative Web Edition was produced by HL7 volunteers, courtesy Alschuler Associates, LLC. Thanks to Woody Beeler of Beeler Consulting for providing source files.

The specifications, schemas and sample files were produced through extraction from the larger database known as the HL7 V3 Normative Edition 2005. If there are discrepancies between this collection and the source, the source is normative. 

Please direct suggestions for enhancements and corrections to webmaster@hl7.org.
